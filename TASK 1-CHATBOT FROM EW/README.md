## PDF Chatbot Project

## Overview

The PDF Chatbot project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to enable users to interact with PDF documents conversationally. This system processes PDF files, extracts their contents, and allows users to query the data in an intuitive and interactive manner. It can be applied in various domains such as education, corporate documentation, and legal research.

## Features

1.PDF Parsing: Efficiently extracts text from PDF files.

2.Question Answering: Enables conversational queries about the content of the PDF.

3.Natural Language Understanding: Utilizes advanced NLP models to understand user queries.

4.Customizable Pipelines: Allows fine-tuning or replacing components for specific use cases.

## Technologies Used

## Programming Language: Python

## Libraries:

PyPDF2 or PyMuPDF: For parsing PDF documents.

transformers (Hugging Face): For pre-trained NLP models.

streamlit or similar: For building an interactive user interface.

langchain: For managing conversational logic and pipelines.

OpenAI or alternative APIs: For advanced question-answering capabilities.

## How It Works

1.Upload PDF: Users upload a PDF document through the web interface.

2.Content Extraction: The system extracts and processes text from the uploaded PDF.

3.Query Processing: Users ask questions in natural language, and the system retrieves relevant answers.

4.Response Generation: The system displays the most relevant answers to the user's query.

## Example Use Case

1.Upload a PDF containing company policies.

2.Ask questions like:

"What is the company's leave policy?"

"When are performance reviews conducted?"

Get precise answers directly from the PDF content.

## Future Enhancements

Add support for multilingual PDFs.

Integrate with vector databases for better information retrieval.

Improve conversational context handling.
